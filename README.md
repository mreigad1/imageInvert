Initial first commit code of Skeleton.cpp and makefile provided by professor Lijun Yin

This project has been written to operate on Mac OSX.

Getting Started:

    1.) Resolve any/all library dependencies by executing "dependency.sh"

    2.) Compile with "make"

    3.) Execute core functionality on provided example inputs with "run.sh"
            Note: Script will look for "example1.tif" and "example2.tif"
                  these may be replaced with any desired test files
